## How to Run the Code

BUILD REQUIREMENTS:
Windows PC OR Mac (OR maybe Linux?) with Unity 2018.4.20f1

EXECUTABLE REQUIREMENTS:
Windows PC.

We've developed a very basic game that is already compiled (and can be ran by unzipping v0.0.6) in the repo's root.

You do not need to build anything, you do not need to download Unity. The game can be run by running "Totally Not Minecraft.exe".

All of the classes we have created are within the Assets/Scripts folder.

. . . However, if you want to build, simply create a project in Unity 2018.4.20f1, import all the assets, and change the build settings to include Scene 0 and 1 as "Main Menu" and "Game". This is what we did, worked fine, but do let us know if there's any issues!

The PDF submission is the 'Project 6.pdf'.



Thanks for the year!
